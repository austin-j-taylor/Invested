# Invested
Invested is a physics simulation and game made in the Unity engine. It is a personal interpretation and emulation of the physics of Allomancy, a magic system from the novel "Mistborn" by Brandon Sanderson.

Here are some short videos of the game:

This Unity project makes use of [Volumetric Lines by Johannes Unterguggenberger](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/tools/particles-effects/volumetric-lines-29160) and a modified shader from [Shrimpy's Outlined Diffuse Shader Fixed](https://github.com/Shrimpey/Outlined-Diffuse-Shader-Fixed).
