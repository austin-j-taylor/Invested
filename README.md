![](demoImage.png)
Invested is a physics simulation and game made in the Unity engine. It is a personal interpretation and emulation of the physics of Allomancy, a magic system from the novel "Mistborn" by Brandon Sanderson.

Here are some videos of the game. Many more can by found [here.](https://gfycat.com/@Artemos)
