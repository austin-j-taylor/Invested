### Collage
Here is a collection of art and other fanworks I liked or used as references for this project. They certainly influenced the art direction so I wanted to credit them.
- ["Luthadel - Mistborn" by carlitusroda](https://www.deviantart.com/carlitusroda/art/Luthadel-Mistborn-715503149)
- [Drawing of the Square of the Survivor by Askhundel](https://www.reddit.com/r/Mistborn/comments/f6l8rh/made_this_drawing_of_the_square_of_the_survivor/)
- [Allomancer's Playground by waai](https://ask.vrchat.com/t/featured-udon-worlds-row/783/12), A VRChat world that implements Allomancy. I've never played it myself, but it looks very fun.

### Special Thanks
- Pagerunner, Argent, Jofwu, and other many other members of the 17th Shard community for discussions on the physics of Allomancy
- Arthur Llorens for ideas and valuable discussions on game design
- Brandon Sanderson for creating these books. I am not affiliated with Brandon Sanderson; this is project made purely out of passion for the cosmere, open-source and free for anyone to play. Based on Brandon's [knowledge base articles](https://faq.brandonsanderson.com/article-categories/films-games-other/) and the fact that I'm not commercializing this project, I don't expect I'll have to take it down.
