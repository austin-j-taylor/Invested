THINK1:
\/?	(...am I... dreaming again?)\%e
THINK2:
\/?	(I've been coming to this place a lot recently... it feels so familiar to me...)
	(but... it's so hard to remember... anything, really.)
	(these movements, though... these \UPulls\c...)
	(These I know. This feels right.)
	(.2.2.2somehow.)\%e
THINK3:
\/?	(who even am I? I feel like I should know who I am.)
	(is that a normal thing?)
	(...)
	(just keep swinging.)
	(hopefully the infinite misty void appreciates my thoughts.)\%e
FACILITY1:
\/?	(this... This is the \LFacility\c. Or maybe the \LLab\c. That's what the engineers called it, right?)
	(...)\%e
FACILITY2:
\/?	(nice little detour. Swinging time again.)
	(\LArea mode\c would be better suited for \UPulling\c on a lot of these guys at once...)\%e
WAKE:
\/? (I'm getting tired... I want to stay here forever, but that thrumming in the back of my mind...)
	(It's time to wake up, soon.)
