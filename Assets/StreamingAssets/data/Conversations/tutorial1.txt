THINK2:
\/?	(I've been coming to this place a lot recently, haven't I?)
	(It feels so familiar to me...)
	(but... it's so hard to remember... anything else, really.)\%
THINK3:
\/?	(I don't even remember what... who I really am.)
	(these movements, though... these \UPulls\c...)

FACILITY1:
\/?	(this... This is the \LFacility\c. Or the \LLab\c?)
	(the... the \LMetallic Arts Research Lab\c. That's what the engineers called it, right?)\%e
FACILITY2:
\/?	(why is this place falling apart... What even happened here?)
	(If I want to keep going, I need to \Ustop focusing\c on \Uindividual targets\c so much...)\%e
WAKE:
\/? (I'm getting tired... I want to stay here forever, but that thrumming in the back of my mind...)
	(It's time to wake up, soon.)\%
