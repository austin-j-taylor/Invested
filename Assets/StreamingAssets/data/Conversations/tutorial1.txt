\/?	(...am I...\p dreaming again?)\%e
THINK2:
\/?	(I've been coming to this place a lot recently...\p it feels so familiar to me...)
	(but...\p it's so hard to remember...\p anything, really.)
	(these movements, though...\p these \UPulls\c...)
	(These I know. This feels right.)
	(.\p2.\p2.\p2somehow.)\%e
THINK3:
\/?	(who even am I? I feel like I should know who I am.)
	(is that a normal thing?)
	(...)
	(just keep swinging.)
	(hopefully the infinite misty void appreciates my thoughts.)\%e
FACILITY1:
\/?	(this... This is the \LFacility\c. Or maybe the \LLab\c. That's what the engineers called it, right?)
	(...)\%e
FACILITY2:
\/?	(nice little detour. Swinging time again.)
	(\LArea mode\c would be better suiting for \UPulling\c on a lot of these guys at once...)\%e
