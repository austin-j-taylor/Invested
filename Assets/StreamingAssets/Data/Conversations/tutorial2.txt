THINK1:
\/?	(what... where am...)
	(Oh. Right. Dreaming again.)\%e
BONK:
\/?	Ow.
	(...that didn't actually hurt.)
	(Feels like it should, though...)\%e
CUBES:
\/?	(Oh hey, it's the floaty cube things. You... didn't you help me out with something?)
	(I hope you don't mind if I \SPush\c you around a bit...)\%e
TURRETS1:
\/?	(\STurrets\c hiding in the alcoves up ahead...)
	(They don't hurt much when I'm dreaming, but they're still...
	(really annoying.)
	(I should really just put up a \SBubble\c.)\%e
TURRETS2:
\/?	(more turrets? and targets? and a... metal lattice thing?)
	(wonder if my \Sbubble\c would be helpful...)\%e
WAKE:
\/?	(This... It's not supposed to be like this.)
	(This place is supposed to be a sort of...\p8 reflection of the \LLab\c. But parts of it are just... here. Entirely.)\%
