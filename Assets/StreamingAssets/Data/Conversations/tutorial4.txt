COINS1:
\/?	(Little bits of metal... coins?\p8 Yeah, coins.)
	(Looks like they were getting shipped from one part of the \LLab\c to another but ended up here. Probably when everything broke.)
	(The letters look so old and weird, but...\p8\n...\fSone imperial\c... "One Imperial."\p4 There's also a building with a bunch of spires on it.)
	(That architecture... we were trying to find... trying to find the city? or... will be trying to find?)
	(urgh. \CkShe's\c so much better at this sort of thing than me.)
	(It might be a sign that I'm on the right path. But then again, space doesn't work like it should here, so...)
	(Anyways.\p8 I can feel a network of little compartments inside me where I can store these things.)
	(I can probably \Gpick up coins\c, then \Gthrow\c them with a \SPush\c.)\%
THINK1:
\/?	(I've gotta hit all these targets before they reset?)\%
THINK2:
\/?	(I feel so slow to react... I'm doing so many calculations about what to target, but I just can't focus quick enough.)
	(Isn't there some way I can... \Zthink faster\c?)\%
BREAK1:
\/?	(Nothing stopping me from just... going on top.)
	(This place really \iis\c rusty.\%
WAKE:
\/?	(The thrumming in the back of my mind... It's getting louder...)
	(It's time... I need to wake up.)\%
