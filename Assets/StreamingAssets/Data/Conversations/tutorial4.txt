THINK1:
	
	
	There's no way I can get through that... I'd have to be \iso\c precise.
	I've got to try anyway, right?
	
	I feel so slow to react... I'm doing so many calculations about what to target, but I just can't focus quick enough.
	isn't there some way I can... think faster?


COINS1:
	A lot of little bits of metal in that crate up ahead...
COINS2:
	They look like... coins?\p8Yeah, definitely coins.
	It seems like they were getting shipped from one part of the \Llab\c to another and somehow ended up here. Probably when everything broke.
	/FSONE IMPERIAL/c..."one Imperial." There's also a building with a bunch of spires on it.
	That architecture... we were trying to find... trying to find the city?
	urgh... why is it so hard to remember anything in here? it's like my thoughts are swimming around me but not actually \iin\c me.
	but... But this is a good sign. We're on the right path.
	Anyways. I've got a network of little compartments where I can store these things, and tiny slots where they can shoot out of...
	I can probably collect coins, then throw them with a \SPush/c.
