COINS1:
\/?	(A lot of little bits of metal near that crate up ahead...)\%
COINS2:
\/?	(They look like... coins?\p8 Yeah, definitely coins.)
	(It seems like they were getting shipped from one part of the Lab to another and somehow ended up here. Probably when everything broke.)
	(The letters look so old and weird, but...\p8\n\fSone imperial\c..."One Imperial." There's also a building with a bunch of spires on it.)
	(That architecture... we were trying to find... trying to find the city?)
	(urgh... why is it so hard to remember anything in here? it's like my thoughts are swimming around but not actually \iin\c me.)
	(but... But this is a good sign. We're on the right path.)
	(Anyways.\p4 I've got a network of little compartments where I can store these things, and tiny slots where they can shoot out of...)
	(I can probably \Gpick up coins\c, then \Gthrow\c them with a \SPush\c.)\%
THINK1:
\/?	(I've gotta hit all these targets before they reset? I'd have to be \iso\c precise...)\%
THINK2:
\/?	(I feel so slow to react... I'm doing so many calculations about what to target, but I just can't focus quick enough.)
	(isn't there some way I can... \Zthink faster\c?)\%
