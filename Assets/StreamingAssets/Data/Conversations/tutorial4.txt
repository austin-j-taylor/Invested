COINS1:
	A lot of little bits of metal in that crate up ahead...
COINS2:
	They look like... coins?\p8Yeah, definitely coins.
	It seems like they were getting shipped from one part of the \Llab\c to another and somehow ended up here. Probably when everything broke.
	/FSONE IMPERIAL/c..."one Imperial." There's also a building with a bunch of spires on it.
	That architecture... we were trying to find... trying to find the city?
	urgh... why is it so hard to remember anything in here? it's like my thoughts are swimming around me but not actually \iin\c me.
