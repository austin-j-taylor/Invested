THINK1:
	(What happened? How did this place get so broken?)
	(poor little souls... never deserved this...)\%
THINK2:
	(The metal I can \SPush and \UPull on is getting scarce here... am I entering a part of the facility with more power?)\%
PEWTER1:
	(No way I could make that jump... and hitting the floor that hard would probably damage my frame.)
	(but if I back up give myself a good running leap with \Wpewter\c...)\%
PEWTER2:
	(Wow. I should keep that up more often.)
	(I'm pretty much \Winvulnerable\c when I have enough \Wpewter\c to block impacts...)\%
PEWTER3:
	(It's really strange how I keep slowly remembering all these things I can do...)
	(Like, up until the moment I need it, I'm vaguely aware of a part of my body with no circulation. It's there, but... sleeping.)
	(Then, when I intentionally need to use it for something, I understand it.)
	(And it feels like I've been using it since forever.)\%
ANCHOR:
	(These flywheels and motors have tracts that are especially conductive. There's something else, too...)
	(I can... extend them? Distribute my mass away from my center?)\%
