THINK1:
\/?	(What happened? How did this place get so broken?)
	(poor little souls... never deserved this...)\%
THINK2:
\/?	(The metal I can \SPush\c and \UPull\c on is getting scarce here... am I entering a part of the facility with more power?)\%
PEWTER1:
\/?	(No way I could make that jump... and hitting the floor that hard would probably damage my body, dreaming or not.)
	(but if I back up give myself a good running leap with \Wpewter\c...)\%
PEWTER2:
\/?	(nice.)
	(I'm pretty much \Winvulnerable\c when I have enough \Wpewter\c to block impacts...)\%
PEWTER3:
\/?	(I feel like I've nearly remembered everything I used to be able to do.)
	(There's still parts of me missing. Limbs I can't stretch yet.)
	(...what are limbs?)\%
ANCHOR:
\/?	(Feeling around myself, there's some conductive tracks around my flywheels and motors... and a few more actuators further in...)
	(I can... extend them? Distribute my mass away from my center?)
	(...make myself a better \Wanchor\c?\%
